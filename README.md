# Google-Cluster-2019-dataset-
The clusterdata-2019 trace dataset provides information about eight different Borg cells for the month of May 2019. It includes the following new information:

CPU usage information histograms for each 5 minute period, not just a point sample;
information about alloc sets (shared resource reservations used by jobs);
job-parent information for master/worker relationships such as MapReduce jobs.
The 2019 traces focus on resource requests and usage, and contain no information about end users, their data, or access patterns to storage systems and other services.

The clusterdata-2019 traces are described in this document: Google cluster-usage traces v3.The data and trace documentation are made available under the CC-BY license. By downloading it or using them, you agree to the terms of this license.
